# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-12-05

Agenda items:
- 2024 meeting time
    - half hour slot should be enough
    - mondays 7am pdt has preference, odd/even doesn't matter
    - action: notify HC
- RISC-V summit FP SIG meeting reflection
    - great interest and questions, especially in the area of AI/ML, questions on status of block formats, posits, decimal floating point
    - need for BF16 and FP8 TGs
    - aim to more closely collaborate with vector SIG and AI/ML SIG in 2024
- Gap analysis
    - document signed-off, few small remaining corrections/additions
- OpenCompute formats
    - this seems to be the formats to get behind and get traction
    - can we collaborate
- BF16 as an arithmetic format
    - Action: kick off TG, focus on scalar first, then extend to vector as that is expected to be the main use, track matrix and kick new TG when appropriate
- FP8 TG
    - kick off after BF16, follow OpenCompute proposal, align with AI/ML group
- Scalar vs vector
    - start building a spreadsheet of where there are inconsistencies for review

AOB:
- There is an initial FP8 min proposal (link posted on the list), feedback welcome

Open actions:
- [ ] Create/share spreadsheet of scalar vs vector support (Al)
- [ ] Request preferred meeting time (Kenneth)
- [ ] Gap analysis final corrections/additions (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [ ] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [ ] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [ ] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [ ] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [ ] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
