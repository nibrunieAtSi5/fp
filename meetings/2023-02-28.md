# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-02-28

Opening:
- much reduced attendence, will send out reminder next time
- introductions
- reviewed minutes of 2023-02-14, no comments

FP catalog:
- reviewed content, various additional formats were high-lighted
    - this is meant to be a live document, continuously keeping it up to date
    - include storage bitwidth to sort by 
    - some formats have different storage and computation formats
    - should add bias, some formats are the same except for the bias
    - Facebook and Microsoft have additional formats, to add, also check ARM and nVidia
    - FP8 numbers have an asociated scaling (and potentially offset)
- the catalog so far is limited to general math or AI/ML, should ask HPC groups and apps & tools for things like physics

Open questions to address in this SIG (not complete):
- how to map an increasing number of format to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- do we consider extensions which have a variable number format support
- do we consider specific formats for e.g. interval arithmetic
- how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point

Actions
- understand software tools and industry needs
    - ask apps & tools about upcoming formats
    - reach out to HPC group
