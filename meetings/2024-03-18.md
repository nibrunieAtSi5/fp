# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2024-03-18

Agenda items:
- BF16 arithmetic need
    - most usage seen is as storage format
    - limited demand for arithmetic, but trend to lower precision formats in AI
    - interest in BF16 paper, put on mailing list
- Scalar-vector consistency need
    - use case driven makes sense
    - scalar-vector reproducible results import for math/scientific applications
    - enable same application to run on core with FPU or core with VPU

Open actions:
- [ ] Send BF16 paper to mailing list (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [~] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [~] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [~] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [~] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [~] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
