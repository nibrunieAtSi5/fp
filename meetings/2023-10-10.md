# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-10-10

Agenda items:
- Booked half an hour on member's day at the RISC-V summit NA
    - Good opportunity to meet in person, and to connect with other groups
- Finished gap analysis document
    - everyone is happy to send out for wider review
- Continue discussion on keeping scalar and vector FP "in sync"
    - good idea in principle, there are some exceptions such as e.g. reductions etc.

AOB:
- N/A

Open actions:
- [ ] Send out gap analysis for review (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [ ] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [x] Potential in person meetup for US summit (Kenneth)
- [ ] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [ ] Highlight and work to resolve gaps in ecosystem support (ongoing)
- [ ] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [ ] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [ ] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
