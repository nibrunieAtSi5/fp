# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-08-15

Agenda items:
- Update on actions, slow progress because of summer time
- Walkthrough of open discusion items:
    - ACTs
        - fp verif is hard, act more for sanity, would really need something like formal
    - BF16 software support
        - Is there C-support, is that intrinsics or libraries or upcoming standard? Reach out to software
    - Opcode space
        - modes are complicating things like interupts, and are painful for sw
        - modes doesn't work for fp8

AOB:
- It would be interesting to learn more about variable number formats. Request presentation?

Resolved actions:
- Do we consider extensions which have a variable number format support
    - Not at this time as it's more a research topic, but we'd like to learn more
- Do we consider specific formats for e.g. interval arithmetic
    - Not at this time as it's more a research topic, but we'd like to learn more
- BF16 subnormal support and rounding mode support
    - Raised github issues
        - argument to keep subnormal support is that accuracy matters for conversions to F32
        - argument to keep all rounding modes is that it is low cost and constistent

New actions:
- Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- Potential in person meetup for US summit

Open actions:
- Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- Highlight and work to resolve gaps in ecosystem support (ongoing)
- Do we need Zfbfwma?
- Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
