# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-02-14

Opening:
 - Purpose of the SIG is strategy, gap analysis, and potentially spawning TGs
 - Initial aim is to present gap analysis in 2 to 3 months

Introductions:
- Good representation (and an impressive amount) of experience on floating point hardware designe, numeric algorithms, compilers
- Industry heavy, see if we can involve more academia
- Important to address software ecosystem, libraries, and tools

Charter:
- Everyone happy with the text as is

Gap analysis
- Not only addressing gaps in number format (hardware) support, also:
   - identify gaps in testing framework for floating point
   - understand software tools and industry needs
   - how to map an increasing number of format to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- Architecture Compatibity Tests, questions like:
   - are act's for quad precision used
   - do new formats have an for tests? TG would have to address the coverage model:
      - corner cases for arithmetic
      - instruction level testing in general
      - not meant as an elaborate fully complete test suite (there are partners who can provide elaborate tests)
      - not checking multiple instructions
      - timing related behavior (e.g. interrupts) not covered
   - contribute to existing test suite by raising a github issue to discuss
- Needs per industry?
   - nearly all new format are for AI/ML, check with apps & tools
   - most AI/ML formats are IEEE-based with different exponent and/or mantissa bits, and sometimes a different bias

Actions
- Ask apps & tools about upcoming formats
- Create spreadsheet to start cataloging formats of interest, for everyone to contribute to
