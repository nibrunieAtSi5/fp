# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-11-06

*In-person meeting at the RISC-V SUMMIT NA 2023*

Introductions:
- large turn-up
- many questions, particularly on AI/ML number formats, and on the status of block formats, posits, decimal floating point

Agenda items:
- Overview of FP SIG remit and status
    - appreciation of the groundwork done last year
    - acknowledgment to focus on BF16 and FP8 in the near term
- Gap analysis feedback
    - thumbs up to finalise
    - few minor corrections/additions remaining
- Continue discussion on merits of format-agnostic instructions
    - add to the Gap analysis document
- Scalar vs vector
    - no time remaining to discuss, moved to next meeting

Open actions:
- [x] Send out gap analysis for review (Kenneth)
- [ ] Gap analysis final corrections/additions (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [ ] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [ ] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [x] Highlight and work to resolve gaps in ecosystem support (ongoing)
- [ ] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [ ] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [ ] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
