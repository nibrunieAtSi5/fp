# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2024-04-15

Agenda items:
- Call for candidates
    - Reviewed required skills, experience with RV process part of template
    - Call is open until May 1st
- AOB
    - scalar-vector-matrix
        - not much focus on scalar, all on matrix/vector, even ofp intended as storage format or to be combined with mx shared exponent
        - matrix/vector/scalar reproducibility important for scientific compute applications
    - FP8
        - Al is tracking P3109, Nicolas is tracking OFP
        - Is anything happening for vector?

Open actions:
- [ ] Send BF16 paper to mailing list (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [~] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [~] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [~] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [~] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [~] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
