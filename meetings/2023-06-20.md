# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2023-06-20

Agenda items:
- RISC-V Summit Europe
    - FP SIG status update
        - Good turn-up
        - Interest in BF16/FP8
        - Scientific computing interest in high-precision floating point and variable precision floating point
    - Community waiting for BF16 support moving forward

Open actions:
- Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- Highlight and work to resolve gaps in ecosystem support (ongoing)
- BF16 subnormal support and rounding mode support (partly done)
- Do we need Zfbfwma?
- Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
- Do we consider extensions which have a variable number format support
- Do we consider specific formats for e.g. interval arithmetic
- Reach out to AI/ML, HPC
