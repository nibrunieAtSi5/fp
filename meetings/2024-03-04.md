# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2024-03-04

Agenda items:
- Recap
- BF16 fast-track or TG
    - use case and plan for encoding questions
    - idea: re-purpose quad precision bit indicating the format from an extended field
    - avoid csr for OoO and FP8 multiple formats
    - no clear overview of encoding space, may be in the vector spreadsheet
- Scalar-vector consistency
    - no widening instruction in scalar, could take the mul/mulh approach, better fit is going to packed

Open actions:
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [~] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [~] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [~] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [~] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [~] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
