Presents:
    Kenneth Rovers (Imagination)
    Nikolai Ternovoi (SMD)

    Peter Tang (RIvos Inc)
    Michael Kennedy (Qualcomm)
    Paul Sherman (Individual)
    
Notes:
- Chair and vice chair elected for one year
- BF16 Task Group: still need a kick-off
    - Will need a draft charter
    - Does RVIA members already support this as proprietary extension ? Will they be interested in presenting ?
    - Opcode space for scalar may be limited (is their an interest for a wide range of operation support in BF16) ?
    - P3109 formats are considering 8-bit format with exact conversions to BF16 (so wider support for BF16 arithmetic could be interesting for this use case) 
    - picking back up
        - wait and see from a hardware perspective as implementation is easy
        - need to know more widely if this needs to be progressed faster -> email mailing list
        - need extension for BF16 conversions to other formats as well
        - both arithmetic and more conversion interesting wrt mixed-format AI use such as with FP8
- 8-bit floating-point - any recent news?
     - OFP8: already available in hardware and ratified (could send an email on the mailing list to ask RISC-V members if they are interested and if they already have some support), so far we have waited, might be time to move
     - AM: P3109: group is still actively discussing specification details, long time away from ratification
     - PT/AM: It might be better to start working on an extension for OFP8 which is already ratified. (P3109 may unfortunately become irrelevant as OFP8, available sooner, may take the market)
     - KR: May be interesting to consider OCP MX scaling formats
     - Spawning a 8-bit TG could help work on the challenge of supporting mulitple formats (encoding space, sideband format encoding through CSR [NT]
     - PT: use-case involves mixed formats (e.g. params and activations encoded in different formats)
     - M: for HPC, CSR change for format change is going to impact uarch perf (need for OoO friendlyness) [AM: similar issue with vset)
     - AM: would like to re-appropriate quad precision encoding for reuse
            - Effort for composable custom extensions https://github.com/grayresearch/CX, https://github.com/riscv/composable-extensions
    - summary: consideration for new formats
        - csr vs encoding, need to understand the use case
        - csr complicates OoO execution
        - many AI formats are used together, how does this fit with the encoding space
        - as a stop gap quad precision bit could be re-purposed to mean "other" format
            - this changes a ratified spec, which complicates matters, there is precedence however
        - composable extensions could be an option as well to explore

- Scalar - vector: conclusions
    - ARC stance: consistency not that important
    - subject moved to next meeting
    - Perhaps, it's just as important for us to understand how we will support formats for both scalar CPU and VPU.As far as I know, there is a discussion in the SiG vector about support for Vector 2.0 64-bit instructions. Perhaps we should keep this in mind https://github.com/riscv-admin/vector/tree/main/minutes/2024/2024-05-13 [NT]
    - When we talk about fp8, we are referring to two new formats, E4M3 and E5M2. For E4M3, there is no definition of infinity. There is only one type of NaN and no two types of zeros. We must take this into account and define it for future potential instructions to convert OCP to fp16 or other classic IEEE-754 formats https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-8-bit-floating-point-specification-ofp8-revision-1-0-2023-12-01-pdf-1 [NT]

Open actions:
- [ ] check mailing list for BF16 extension timelines (Kenneth/Nicolas)
- [ ] check mailing list for OFP8 and MX support interest and timelines (Kenneth/Nicolas)
- [x] Send BF16 paper to mailing list (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [~] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [~] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [~] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [~] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [~] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
