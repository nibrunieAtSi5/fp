# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2024-05-13

Agenda items:
- New term and new vice-chair
- Open items
    - BF16 arithmetic paused - picking back up
        - wait and see from a hardware perspective as implementation is easy
        - need to know more widely if this needs to be progressed faster -> email mailing list
        - need extension for BF16 conversions to other formats as well
        - both arithmetic and more conversion interesting wrt mixed-format AI use such as with FP8
    - FP8 - any recent news?
        - IEEE still discussing definition, long time away from ratification
        - OFP8 is ratified, so far we have waited, might be time to move
        - similarly gather interest from mailing list in OFP8 extension 
    - consideration for new formats
        - csr vs encoding, need to understand the use case
        - csr complicates OoO execution
        - many AI formats are used together, how does this fit with the encoding space
        - as a stop gap quad precision bit could be re-purposed to mean "other" format
            - this changes a ratified spec, which complicates matters, there is precedence however
        - composable extensions could be an option as well to explore

Open actions:
- [ ] check mailing list for BF16 extension timelines (Kenneth/Nicolas)
- [ ] check mailing list for OFP8 and MX support interest and timelines (Kenneth/Nicolas)
- [x] Send BF16 paper to mailing list (Kenneth)
- [ ] Reach out to SW & tools about BF16 C-support
- [~] Is it desirable to in general keep vector and scalar floating point support in sync?
    - Do we need a vector version of Zfa?
- [ ] Check with AI/ML, HPC and vector SIGs for recent updates
- [~] Understand software tools and industry needs (partly done)
- [~] Do we need Zfbfwma?
- [ ] Understand status, quality, coverage of testing frameworks, i.e. ACT (how to identify gaps in testing framework for floating point)
- [~] How to map an increasing number of formats to a limited opcode space (e.g. what goes to the very limited compressed 16-bit)
- [~] Look at available opcode space, opcode vs CSR mode
