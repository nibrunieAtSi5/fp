# Floating-Point (FP) SIG Charter

There is a large and growing interest in new FP formats and
operations, beyond the IEEE-754/2008 standard incorporated in the
standard RISC-V scalar F, D, and Q extensions ratified in 2019, and
the Zfh/Zfhmin and vector extensions ratifed in 2021.

The FP SIG is managed under the Unpriv Committee, and is intended to
develop the strategy, gaps, and prioritizations for all future FP
enhancements for RISC-V.  The SIG will examine new FP formats in
addition to further enhancements to the IEEE FP standard.  This SIG is
intended to provide a venue for community members to discuss and
select which ideas should advance into eventual future standard
extensions.

We intend that this SIG will be ongoing and spawn or help spawn new
TGs as appropriate to fulfil the strategy.  An important role of the
SIG is prioritizing which extensions to pursue next and to limit the
scope of new TGs to develop extensions that can be completed in
bounded time with the constrained resources available.

This group will work with the Software Committees to ensure that any
support needed in the ecosystem for them will be discussed between the
groups.
